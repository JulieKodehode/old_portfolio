## Sample project for a web page from Lars Gunnar

This [page](https://github.com/LarsGKodehode/react-example-simple-website) provides an example of how you to structure a standard web site. The standard followed here aligns to Next.js convention. With the folder names being the name we use when importing.

To achieve this we are providing a index.js files inside every folder (webpack is looking for this, unless given a specific filename). We have also setup a jsconfig.json to enable us to use absolute file paths when importing rather than having to use relative file paths.
